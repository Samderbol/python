- You can package it for personal use, but you can't distribute it. 
  - For example: You can teach others how to package it to avoid spending money to buy App, but you can't directly distribute the App you packaged.
  - Why do I have to do this? 
    - Security: If anyone inject malicious code into the source code and distribute it, it will cause a lot of trouble.
    - Income: Apple developer account = $99 per year. As a freshly graduated independent developer, I need income.
- Except for the above, apply the `GPLv3` license.
